- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Assistant**: Natural language interface that understands your intent
- üß† **Smart Execution**: Automatically handles prerequisite actions and complex workflows
- üìä **Knowledge Fetching**: Dynamically learns API capabilities and requirements

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/picahq/onetool-demo.git
cd onetool-demo
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory from the `.env.example` file:**
```env
PICA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|

| `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Your Google API key | No |
